# Disclaimer

I generally dislike writing or talking about myself as I can be self-critical. This is especially true when looking back more than a year ago when I was just beginning to learn.

# Intro

My first time spent working on a web project was by first creating a [wiki] [] 
that would document my laboratory experience while working at Dr. Carlos [Castro's] [] lab. I find [openwetware][wetware] to be a model format for other students in scientific lab to document their research, and I'd like to encourage all investigators to make their students write their notebooks in an online or at least digital format, which makes archiving 100x better. Although I doubt openwetware will take off, there are likely other wiki hosting formats for the scientific community.

I later then did the design for the 2013 Ohio Mod team's [website][ohiomod] (slightly broken).This was primarily an exercise in Adobe Illustrator as pages are in fact a gif format with sliced links.

I came to quickly enjoy for making other designs for scientific figures, documents, and posters.



### Links to reports for research

### Links to the posters of previous research projects.

I wanted to build an online portfolio that would incorporate my previous projects and art projects. 

I first started by following website and php tutorials online, with my very first tutorial series on building a dynamic website by [digicraft][] (I am very proud that I could remember the youtube channel). My very first website from scratch using php, bootstrap, and many jquery libraries was my [first about me][] website. 

My very first framework was [code igniter][] which was quickly replaced by [laravel](laravel.com) by [Taylor Otwell][]. I have a fond memory of Laravel in its similarity and improvements to ruby on rails. The laravel framework was my first impression of how to implement a model view controller framework and object-relational mapping. The [laracasts video tutorials](https://laracasts.com/) by [Jeffrey Way][way] were especially useful.

During the time I was learning the Laravel framework I was attempting to implement my first startup application: X-Press Cards. It was meant to be an online service for designing and printing cards. The laravel version was first [x-press cards][xcards]. Future versions include
